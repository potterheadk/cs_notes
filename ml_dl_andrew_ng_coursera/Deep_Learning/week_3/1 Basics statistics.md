These basics help in understanding data distribution, which is crucial for machine learning models to generalize well.
 
### 1. Mean
**Definition**: The average of a set of values.
**Example**: If you have numbers 2, 4, and 6, the mean is (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 4.

### 2. Median
**Definition**: The middle value of a sorted list. If there's an even number of values, it's the average of the two middle values.
**Example**: For 1, 3, 7, 9, and 11, the median is 7. For 2, 4, 6, and 8, the median is 
$$(4 + 6) / 2 = 5.$$

### 3. Mode
**Definition**: The most frequently occurring value(s) in a set.
**Example**: In the numbers 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4, the mode is 2, as it appears most often.

### 4. Variance
**Definition**: A measure of how much values in a set differ from the mean. Higher variance indicates more spread.
**Example**: For 2, 4, and 6, the mean is 4. The variance is the average of squared differences from the mean:  
\[
$$((2-4)^2 + (4-4)^2 + (6-4)^2) / 3 = 2.67$$
\]

### 5. Standard Deviation
**Definition**: The square root of variance, indicating how much values typically differ from the mean. It’s in the same units as the original data.
**Example**: With variance of 2.67, the standard deviation is √2.67 ≈ 1.63.
